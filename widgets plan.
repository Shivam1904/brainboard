widgets plan. 
the main screen of the brain board 
- displays a list of widgets with a size. 

lets create a new file to distribute the widgets from a new plan. 
'NewDashboard' - in place of ResponsiveGridLayout. 

there will be a left side bar, a right sidebar and a main component in the center. 

right sidebar will have the following in order:
    weather widget.
    simple clock.
    brainy AI chat widget. 
    
left will have the following:
    all schedules widget.
    mood tracker
    notes.

the above 6 widgets are view widgets and can be added and removed from a checkbox in AddWidgetButton component. 

for each widget to be added in the sidebars - we should have a container. 
the container will have a button in the top right corner to expand or collapse the widget 
    - using the same logic as used in the checkbox in views to hide and show the view widgets 
    - expanded will show the widget and collapsed will only show the name of the widget .


main component - 
leave blank for now.
